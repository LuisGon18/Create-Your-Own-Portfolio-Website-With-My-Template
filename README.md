## Repository Content

This repository contains the code for the template I created for my own portfolio website.

## Description

The template is built using HTML, and CSS. It is used to showcase your projects, skills, and contact information to potential employers or collaborators.

## Files 

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the website. 
- **style.css:** The CSS file containing the styles for the website.
- **.png:** Images used around the whole template.

 ## Customization
 
Before trying to customize the template take your time to read and understand the code, I've added plenty of comments for this.

After reading the whole code and understanding it, feel free to customize the content and styles to match your personal branding and preferences. You can modify the HTML to update project details, skills, and contact information, similarly, you can adjust the CSS to change colors, fonts, layout, etc.

You can clone or add other sections if needed and you can add or change the images to your liking.


### Here are some tips for styling your page

- **Website Theme Colors:** You can use [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate a theme for your website and use the colors codes it provides on your css, or you can also use a brwoser extension such as [Amazing color picker](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/amazing-color-picker/ckanipeahakkplheflddneeekginnkod) to browse websites you like and draw inspiration from their themes.
- **Background Images:** Use websites such as [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com) for background images.
- **Socials Logos:** For your socials I've added each social logo and hyperlinked it to my pages, use [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons) to search for your socials logo in various styles. Add as many socials as you like and remember to hyperlinked them to your personal pages.
